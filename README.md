# python-api-challenge

This repository contains a Python API Challenge. The challenge consisted of two parts.

# Part I: WeatherPy
Use a python script to visualize the weather of 500+ random cities across the world of varying distance from the equator.
* Use the data to create a series of scatter plots to show the relationship between Latitude and weather conditions
* Run linear regression on each relationship, separating them into Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere.


# Part II: VacationPy
* Use jupyter-gmaps and Google Places API to create a heat map for every city from part I.
* Narrow down the list of cities to those with favourable temperature, cloudiness and wind speed conditions.
* Using Google Places API, find a hotel for each city within 5km of the city centre.
* Plot the hotels on the humidity heatmap with each pin containing the Hotel Name, City, and Country
